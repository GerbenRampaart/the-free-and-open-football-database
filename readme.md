The goal of the free and open football database is to collect (and keep up to date) all
of the players, teams, competitions and tournament data in a easy data format (json).

I don't actually intend to keep a record of the played matches and their results, awarded cards, scored
goals and such things which have to be kept up to data weekly / daily.

We will however try to collect:
- All players and their properties (name, position, squad number and so on).
- All teams they played for, both club teams and national teams.
- Other stuff? We'll see.
